JavaScript modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable units. 
They allow developers to create self-contained code components that can be easily imported and used in other parts of their codebase.

JavaScript modules can be defined using the import and export keywords. 
The export keyword is used to expose functions, objects, or values from a module, 
while the import keyword is used to bring in those exports from another module.

Here is an example of a module that exports a function:

javascript

// math.js module
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
This module exports a single function called add, which takes two arguments and returns their sum. 
The export keyword exposes this function as part of the module's public API.

To use this module in another part of your codebase, you would use the import keyword like this:

javascript

// app.js module
import { add } from './math.js';

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
In this example, the import keyword is used to bring in the add function from the math.js module. 
The curly braces around add indicate that we only want to import that one function. 
Once imported, we can use the add function in our app.js module just like any other function.

JavaScript modules can also be used to export classes, objects, and even entire libraries. 
By breaking code into small, reusable modules, developers can write more modular and maintainable code.
