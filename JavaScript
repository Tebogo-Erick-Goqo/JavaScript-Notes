JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
It is a client-side scripting language, which means it is executed on the user's computer, rather than on the web server.

JavaScript allows web developers to add interactivity to their websites, such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content. 
It can also be used to create full-fledged web applications, and even mobile apps using frameworks like React Native and Ionic.

JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and can be used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create rich and engaging user experiences. 
It is a versatile language that can also be used on the server-side with technologies like Node.js.

Some popular libraries and frameworks built on top of JavaScript include jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue.js.
