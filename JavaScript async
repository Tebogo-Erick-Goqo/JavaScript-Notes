JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it can only execute one task at a time.
However, it is common for JavaScript applications to need to perform long-running or blocking operations, 
such as making a network request or accessing a database. 
These operations can cause the main thread to become blocked, leading to slow performance and a poor user experience.

To address this issue, JavaScript provides the async and await keywords, which allow for asynchronous, non-blocking code execution.

The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, which will always return a promise.
Within an async function, the await keyword can be used to pause execution until a promise is resolved or rejected. 
This allows for asynchronous operations to be performed in a sequential, synchronous-like manner.

Here's an example of an async function that makes a network request using the fetch() API:

javascript

async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
In this example, the fetch() method returns a promise that resolves to a response object. 
The await keyword is used to pause execution until the promise is resolved, 
and the response data is then extracted using the json() method, which also returns a promise. 
The await keyword is used again to pause execution until the second promise is resolved, 
and the final data is returned as a result of the async function.

Overall, using async and await in JavaScript can make it easier to write and maintain asynchronous code, 
improving the performance and user experience of JavaScript applications.
